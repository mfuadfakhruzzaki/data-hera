## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Pastel blue (#A7D1E8) for a calm and reliable feel.
- Secondary color: Pastel pink (#FFB3C6) as a gentle and friendly accent.
- Background color: Light off-white (#F8F8FF) to provide a soft backdrop.
- Body and headline font: 'Plus Jakarta Sans', providing a modern and readable feel.
- Use a set of professional, clean icons with a pastel color palette to represent different data points and actions within the app. These icons will be simple, geometric, and easily recognizable.
- Mobile-first layout with a card-based design for both the input form and the data table, ensuring a responsive and easy-to-navigate experience on all devices.
- Smooth and interactive animations to highlight user interactions (e.g., row highlight on hover, feedback on data entry, loading indicators), providing a polished and engaging user experience.
